# 3rd Party Script

I have added google analytics to my portfolio website so that it tracks or enables data collection due to how visitors engage in the website. It also enables the analysis or monitoring with other applications. 

I have also included a scriot that enables the pulling out of tweet stream. 

(I have attached this feature in my portfolio website at the bottom of my media page)


NOTE: I was having hard time understanding the link.md file, which asks to put a link to the solution that is hosted only.
      I added my solutions to the cloned Hw-3 folder, and I deployed the new ammended folder for Hw-4.
      I tried to deploy a folder that has the new added files, but firebase was initiationg a new index.html and It wasn't
      displaying output to the solutions.
