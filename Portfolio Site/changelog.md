# 3rd Party Script

I have added google analytics to my portfolio website so that it tracks or enables data collection due to how visitors engage in the website. It also enables the analysis or monitoring with other applications. 

I have also included a scriot that enables the pulling out of tweet stream. 

(I have attached this feature in my portfolio website at the bottom of my media page)
