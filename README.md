NOTE: I was having hard time understanding the link.md file, which asks to put a link to the solution that is hosted only.
      I added my solutions to the cloned Hw-3 folder, and I deployed the new ammended folder for Hw-4.
      I tried to deploy a folder that has the new added files, but firebase was initiationg a new index.html and It wasn't
      displaying output to the solutions.
